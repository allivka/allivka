<h2 align="center">About me</h2>

1. The only programming language I know is the c++
2. I have some basic python understanding because I learned it once
3. All my code that can be used as an utility i put into my ADUL(Alivka's Different Utilities Library) library
4. I am currently working on the project called AGE(Alivka's Graphics Engine) which is a purely featured game engine for doom/wolfeingstein 3d graphics style
5. I use linux as my main workspace os not because i really understand how it works but because for me it's way more convenient for programming
6. I use OpenSuse Tumbleweed linux distribution
